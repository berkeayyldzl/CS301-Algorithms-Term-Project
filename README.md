# CS301-Algorithms-Term-Project
This repository hold both the term project reports and the necessary codes for the CS301 Algorithms course on Sabanci University.

The project focuses on the graph colouring problem, a well-known problem in computer science. Two methods were implemented to tackle this problem: the brute force approach and the DSatur algorithm. The brute force method explores all possible colourings to find the optimal solution, while the DSatur algorithm employs a more efficient strategy by considering the saturation degree of vertices to colour the graph.
